# library

A self-hosted ebook library server: browse a book collection and send titles
to a Kindle by email. See [DESIGN.md](https://github.com/meandnano/AppLibris/blob/init/DESIGN.md)
on the `init` branch for the full design, and [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for
what's actually built so far.

## Search

The search box on the library page filters the grid as you type — there's
no separate results page. It searches title, authors, description and
ISBN, matching on word prefixes (typing "har pot" finds "Harry Potter"
while you're still typing, in either word order) and ignoring diacritics
in both directions (searching "tokarczuk" finds a stored "Tokarczuk", and
vice versa). Typing an ISBN finds the book regardless of whether it's
punctuated with hyphens or not.

Filtering is live via [htmx](https://htmx.org): each keystroke fires a
debounced request that swaps in just the matching grid, so the page never
does a full reload while you type. With JavaScript disabled, the same
search box still works as a plain form — submitting it reloads the page
with the results already filtered server-side, using the exact same
`?q=` URL the live version keeps in the address bar. That URL is
shareable and bookmarkable either way.
