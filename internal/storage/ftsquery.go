// SanitizeFTSQuery turns raw user input into a valid FTS5 MATCH expression.
// Raw input is almost never valid FTS5 query syntax on its own — a stray
// `"`, `(`, `-` or a bare AND makes MATCH return an error — so every
// whitespace-separated token is escaped, quoted and turned into a prefix
// term, then joined with an implicit AND: "har pot" becomes `"har"*
// "pot"*`, matching "Harry Potter" while it's still being typed, in either
// word order. Because every token is quoted, none of FTS5's own operator
// syntax can reach MATCH unescaped, so no input — however adversarial —
// produces an expression FTS5 rejects.
//
// Input with no non-whitespace content returns "", which callers treat as
// "no search" (the full list) rather than a query that matches nothing.
